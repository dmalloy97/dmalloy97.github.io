# About Me
## My interests
  I love to read books, mostly romance and mystery. A plus if there's a sequel.
  I enjoy putting together lego sets. Mainly the Harry Potter ones but I do have suculents and Paul Walker's car as well.
  If I'm not reading or putting together a lego set, I'm playing The Sims 4, Hogwarts, or Disney Dreamlight Valley on PS5.
## Websites I Recommend
  -[Bookstore] (https://barnesandnoble.com) - I like this website because you can find more than just books.
  -[Legos] (https://lego.com) - I enjoy this website because you can find all kinds of legos and every piece to each set they have as well.
